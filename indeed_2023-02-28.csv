Engineering at BringFido
The BringFido engineering team builds the BringFido.com website, apps for iOS and Android, and our data pipelines. We’re responsible for UI execution, data modeling, search engine presence, performance, PCI-level security, accessibility, and internal tools for our customer support agents and content writers.
Our front end is HTML & CSS using the AMP framework, originally developed by Google. Unlike many publishers who publish AMP pages alongside their traditional Javascript pages, our site is AMP-first. We care a lot about clean code, conventions, semantics, and simplicity. These habits give us the environment we need to serve millions of monthly visitors with a small engineering team.
Candidates for this position should be experienced (>5 years) web application developers. They should be fluent in Django and the associated stack (Python, Postgres, Linux web servers, etc.) and be very comfortable in an AWS environment. They will also have a high level of HTML/CSS chops. Experience with AMP is a big plus but not required if you’re a quick learner.
Our headquarters is in lovely Greenville, SC, but this is a remote position; we follow a location-independent workflow. Experience with remote collaboration and self-management is important. We use Slack, GitHub, and Shortcut, and we travel for in-person working meetups.
Finally, we love animals and travel. Several BringFido employees are involved with animal care organizations, and many of us have been taking crazy adventures with our pets over the last decade. If you’re a dog person, you’ll fit right in.
